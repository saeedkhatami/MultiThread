# Multithread
A fundamental starting point for newcomers to C++ programming who wish to delve into the world of multithreading and understand how threads interact with your workloads.

# What's Included?
It's as straightforward as it gets: the default console application template from Visual Studio. The key distinction is that everything you execute now operates on distinct threads, effectively distributing tasks across the available CPU cores.

# Is this base complete, or are there elements missing?
This base was intentionally designed for educational purposes, mimicking a classroom-style approach. It serves as a simplified foundation for basic threading operations and is not intended for handling complex tasks like sorting workloads. However, if you have the time and inclination, you can customize it to align with your specific requirements and preferences."
