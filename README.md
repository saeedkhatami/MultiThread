# Multithread Foundation
This foundational framework is tailored for aspiring C++ programmers who are taking their initial steps into the world of multithreading. It offers a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of threads and their interaction with your computing tasks.

# What's Included?
At its core, this package provides a standard console application template as offered by Visual Studio. The key distinction here is that every operation you initiate is executed concurrently on distinct threads, effectively leveraging the processing power corresponding to the number of CPU cores you possess. Additionally, this package incorporates some rudimentary content related to game hacking, aimed at delivering a basic grasp of both external and internal game manipulation techniques.

# Feature Highlights
- A user-friendly interface with automated multithreading capabilities, including custom CPU affinity support.
- Memory management library for attaching/detaching from a process, reading/writing process memory, and external signature scanning.
- Threading library for efficient management of threads.
- DLL file injection methods (LoadLibrary and manual mapping) alongside shellcode injection, albeit with hardcoded shellcode.
- A comprehensive logging system to track your application's behavior.
- Simplified function wrappers, designed to assist newcomers in grasping concepts like function pointers.

# Upcoming Developments
In the pipeline are plans for integrating a straightforward driver communication method. This includes the addition of a basic driver source code (sans certification), though it will necessitate disabling certain Windows security features. A practical example showcasing the inner workings of these components will also be included.

# Is There Anything Missing from This Framework?
It's important to note that this framework was created primarily for educational purposes, resembling a skeleton structure for basic threading operations. It is not intended for intricate threading tasks or sophisticated workload management. However, it offers a solid starting point that can be customized to meet your specific needs and preferences.
